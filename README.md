Introduction:

WhoSaidThat gives you quotations from famous historical figures. 

The first search is a basic search for an author.
This generates a picture, the person's name, his DOB, industry/occupation, and nationality.

In the second search, you type in the author's industry, DOB, nationality, or a part/bit/phrase/string of the quote to find that person.
